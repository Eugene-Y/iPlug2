# T-013 — Host matrix (P10)

- **Status:** ready (best after T-019 and T-010, so the tested build is close to final)
- **Owner:** — (planned: coordinator; it is mostly VM time)
- **Branch/worktree:** `linux/T-013` from `hvoya-linux`, in `/Volumes/Storage/code/IPlug2-T-013` — for harness/docs and any host-compat fix.
- **Depends on:** T-002, T-007 (merged). Products: Gneiss (T-003), Sand (T-012).
- **Plan phase:** P10.
- **Conflicts:** uses the VM (lock, AGENTS §5). A host-compat fix in IGraphicsLinux/wrappers is coordinated with whoever holds those files.

## Goal
Gneiss, Sand, IPlugControls and IPlugInstrument work in the Linux hosts people use, not only REAPER: load, editor, automation, state, latency, multi-instance, close.

## Hosts
- **VM (arm64, GNOME X11):** Carla (CLAP + VST3; apt), Ardour 8 (VST3; CLAP if the version has it; apt or ardour.org arm64), Renoise (arm64 build; demo), Qtractor (CLAP/VST3), Zrythm if packaged for arm64. Also a GNOME **Wayland** session (XWayland) for one host.
- **Not possible here:** Bitwig (x86_64 only), x86_64 in general, NVIDIA/AMD drivers. Write a short checklist for a PC run.
- Installing on the VM needs `sudo`. Key auth only, never a password. If sudo asks for a password, stop and ask the user (through the coordinator) to install the packages.

## VM rules (it hangs under GL load — STATUS "Environment gotchas")
Short batches; `timeout 8 xdpyinfo` before and after each batch; kill everything you started; no display-mode or scale changes; churn only in Docker. Release the lock between batches.

## Cases per host × product × format
1. Scan/load; editor opens at the right size, renders (screenshot reviewed by eye), resizes (host- and plug-in-initiated), HiDPI where the host offers it.
2. Keyboard: text entry, host shortcuts still work with the editor focused; mouse: drag, wheel, right-click menus.
3. Automation write/read; parameter names/values/text in the host's UI.
4. Save/reload the project with the editor open and closed; presets (CLAP/VST3 state).
5. Latency change (Gneiss OS factor) with the editor closed — host PDC follows.
6. Two instances; close the editor while a menu or text entry is open; remove the plug-in while playing.
7. Host-loop trace build (`-DIPLUG_TRACE_HOST_LOOP`): which backend the host gives us (CLAP timer/fd support, VST3 `IRunLoop` and from where), everything on the main thread. **Decides T-010's open point:** if a host (Bitwig, Renoise) gives VST3 `IRunLoop` only through the plug frame, item 5 for VST3 runs on the fallback thread, and REAPER-style hosts drop that latency change (T-010 Log). Report it to the user; the user chose no framework change until such a host shows up.
8. Files dropped from GNOME Files (and a Qt file manager if available) onto the editor (`scripts/vm/probe/files-drop.sh`
   with Gneiss' USER tab, or `steps/igraphicstest-drop.txt` in Docker). The editor's window is XdndAware; whether a
   drop reaches it depends on the host: REAPER forwards drags to XdndAware children itself (but only a source's first
   three types, T-019 R6). Record per host whether it forwards, is XdndAware itself, or neither (then file managers
   cannot drop onto plug-ins); a trace build (`-DIGRAPHICS_TRACE_LINUX_INPUT`) logs `iPlug2 drop:` lines. Also a
   tooltip (Sand) in each host.

## Acceptance
- [ ] Matrix table (host × product × format × case) in the Log with evidence paths (`evidence/t013/`).
- [ ] Every failure: fixed (Linux-only code, own commit) or ticketed with a minimal repro; host bugs documented as such.
- [ ] PC checklist for Bitwig/x86_64 written.
- [ ] Independent review (AGENTS §4); Log complete.
